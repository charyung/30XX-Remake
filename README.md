The year is 30XX. The world has gone beyond playing Fox and gone beyond settling matches via port priority and Rock Paper Scissors. Nintendo no longer bothers putting in characters from any franchise but Pok√©mon. Top players from the 21st century have been revived and uploaded to computers so they can play matches 24/7. Every match ends in a stalemate and Nintendo has decided to start over.
